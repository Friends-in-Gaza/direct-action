      <h2>Donation Breakdown</h2>
      <p><strong>$1020.88 Total Donations Raised</strong>
      </p>
      <p>In agreement with Taha and Hashem, we decided to split the total donations between each friend's family according to the number of family members in each. Taha's family has 5 members. Hashem's family has 8. Aya & Adel have 6. That makes 19 people altogether, so the donations were split into 19 shares. Each family has been given their fair share in order to be as fair as possible.</p>
      <p>We weren't able to ask Aya or Adel for their input on how donations should be split because we lost contact with them on August 18th and didn't regain contact until September 2nd, after the event's end.</p>

      <p>All families have received their shares of donations according to their own preferences. Additional late donations received after the event's end have been split and distributed the same way.</p>
      <p>Thank you so much to everyone who donated!</p>
