  <h3>Demand France Re-Accept Refugees!</h3>

  <p>The French National Court of Asylum ruled in July 2025 that 100% of Palestinians are eligible for asylum in France. Not long afterward on August 1, 2025, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot suspended all evacuations of refugees from Gaza into France. He made this decision on the basis of a single refugee student in France accused of posting antisemitic content.</p>

  <p>This decision is yet another example of a government collectively punishing Palestinians. Countless innocent students remain in Gaza awaiting evacuation while enduring the constant threat of genocide as Israel continues to bomb homes, schools, and hospitals.</p>

  <p>Collectively punishing all innocent people seeking asylum for one person’s actions is obviously wrong. These people only want safety and the chance to live normal lives.</p>

  <p>The UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was "appalled" by reports of Palestinians killed while trying to get food aid. The UN Human Rights Council and other UN experts have warned that Israel is using food as a weapon, which is a war crime. Amnesty International and even Israeli human rights groups like B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel say Israel is committing genocide.</p>

  <p>France must restart evacuations now. Students from Gaza are part of the global majority. They deserve safety and a future.</p>
